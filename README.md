# ISP STATS

![Grafana](/images/grafana.png?raw=true "Grafana")

## Description
The following package is meant to provide an easy way to regularly measure your internet connection speed and create some stats.
You can easily set up this script on a raspberry pi with raspbian and keep it running in the background.

The data can be used to confront your ISP if your speed is way below the promised speed.

For setting up the machine you need a linux machine because ansible does not run on windows.

The setup runs [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) every hour and collects the stats from the nearest [speedtest.net](http://www.speedtest.net/) server.
The data is written into a time series database ([InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/)) and displayed in a preconfigured dashboard using [Grafana](http://grafana.org/). You can also export all data from the dashboard as CSV for further offline processing.

**Hint:** If you want to use a raspberry older than model `3 B+` and have a fast internet connection (>100Mbps) you can not use the device as it can only handle 100Mbps at a maximum. To handle greater speeds you need to use a [Raspberry 3 B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/).

## Using Ansible
* Install python and git
* Install Ansible: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#installing-the-control-machine
* Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/FireFart/isp_stats.git`
* edit `ansible/hosts` and change IP address
* Be sure `root` login via SSH key is enabled on the remote machine and your public key is installed
* `ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts ansible/site.yml`
* Open `http://ÃŒP/dashboard/db/isp-stats` in your browser
* The admin User is `admin`, the password can be found in `ansible/grafana_password` (do not delete this file!)
* All passwords and keys are generated on the first run so there are no default passwords to change after installation

## Using Vagrant
`vagrant up`

## Install on a raspberry pi
* download the raspbian-lite zip and extract it https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
* write the extracted image to sdcard https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/
* Create an empty file in the mounted `boot` partition with name `ssh` (without an extension) to enable the ssh deamon on start
* Connect the raspberry using an ethernet cable to your router. Don't use WIFI as it is probably slower than your internet connection and would give false statistics. If your internet connection is faster or around 100Mbps you will need the use a [Raspberry 3 B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) or later as older raspberries only have a 10/100 ethernet interface and a shared USB-Bus which limits the overall speed. Model 3B+ added a Gigabit Interface so the device is now able to handle greater speeds.
* Connect power
* Login via SSH with user `pi` and password `raspberry`
* sudo raspi-config
  * Expand Filesystem
  * Change User Password
  * Change Locale
  * Change Timezone
  * Finish --> Reboot
* `mkdir /root/.ssh` and add your public key to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
* Run ansible as described above

## My current Raspberry Pi Configuration (not working at full speed at the moment)
* [Raspberry 3 B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
* 8GB micro SD card
* OS is raspbian-lite (no GUI)
